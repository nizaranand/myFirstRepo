It can be installed in a 12 inch shallow foundation. The 3600S has a flush mounted barrier plate design with dual actuators and no protruding buttresses above grade. The flush mount design eliminates problems with snowplows and street sweepers. Single entrances up to 22 feet in width can be secured with the 3600S model.<\/p><p>The 3600S has a proprietary Electric Power Control Unit (EPU) that has been designed for complex integration of Access Control Points (ACP) enabling the barrier to be inter-faced with other electronic security products. We have many years of integration experience to meet any specific needs a customer may have.<\/p>","options":{"use-global-options":"0","layout-type":"full","left_sidebar_type":"","right_sidebar_type":"","show_header_sidebars":"0","show_page_header":"1","boxed-layout":"0","background-color":"","background-image":"","background-repeat":"no-repeat","background-attachment":"scroll","background-position":"left center","local-title-background-color":"","local-title-background-image":"","local-title-background-repeat":"no-repeat","local-title-background-attachment":"scroll","local-title-background-position":"left center","slider-category":"home-page","show_header_slider":"1","slider-effect":"fade","slider-fullwidth":"1","slider-position":"static","slider-animation-time":"1802","slider-easing":"easeInOutQuint","slider-height":"","portfolio_type":"document","portfolio_data_url":"","portfolio_video_width":"640","portfolio_video_height":"360","portfolio_link_target":"_self","general-post-options_noncename":"9dd866ca72","excerpt":"","comment_status":"0","ping_status":"0"}}
